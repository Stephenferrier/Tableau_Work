	For CitiBike there were several steps in making the visuals and the findings are reflective of the interactable items created. This data set was impacted by the pandemic that slowed CitiBike to a comparative halt. Other years should not be compared to this data without accounting for the pandemic.
	Start and end stations are mapped with additional filters to display the frequency of use by CitiBike users. Stations are rather prominent within New York City and the map easily gets covered in data. Due to the covid pandemic, the usage of CitiBikes decreased as less people needed to consistently go outside. However, some of the high usage stations (Grove St.Path) saw an increase in usage during this time. This could suggest that behavior patterns during the pandemic led people to seeking more open spaces as living spaces in New York are rather small. Since general public space was shut down at the time, people started to bike as to not stay in one place. The summer/warmer half of the year sees much more use of CitiBikes compared to the colder/winter months. There is also and increase in "Unknown" users, or non-members, during the pandemic time. 
	Overall, there is a notable and observable impact that the pandemic had on CitiBike and this could be seen in the data. User variance, bike frequency, station selection are just some of the areas that saw significant change and further research is needed to explore the severity of these changes.
